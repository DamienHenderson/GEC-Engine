Milestone 1 v1 12/10/2017

Features:
- Multicoloured starfield
- clear framebuffer to colour, greyscale or other framebuffer
- set pixel to arbitrary colour
- blit framebuffer to screen
- control of the viewing angle with the xbox 360 controller
- control of the eye distance with the up and down arrow keys
- stars are drawn larger when they are closer

Code Changes:
- Added Screen class
- Added FrameBuffer class
- Added Star struct

Tests:
- Starfield appears to work from visual inspection as stars appear to change size as they get closer which is the expected result
- Clearing the screen to a colour works as the intended colour is reproduced correctly when using the provided "PackRGBA" function
- The framerate is acceptable with normal rendering such as 100 thousand stars
- see Performance.txt
Notes:
- several files which are not relevant to this milestone have been omitted from code changes for the sake of brevity
